# eurlex_case_law_directory

Python code to create mapping between case-law directory classification before and after the Treaty of Lisbon (in effect since 2010). The code takes the pre-Lisbon classification scheme (level 1 and 2) and assigns post-Lisbon categories, where applicable. 

Code can be plugged into your data project. 

The purpose is to simplify the comparison of case-law development in the EU over time.
