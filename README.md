# eurlex_case_law_directory

Scholars of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) are interested in the development of case-law over time. However, the CJEU implemented a fundamental change to the classification scheme in its directory of case-law after the Treaty of Lisbon (in effect since 2010). Link to source: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/directories/new-case-law.html

Here I offer some Python code to create a mapping between the case-law directory classification schemes before and after Lisbon. The code takes the pre-Lisbon classification scheme (level 1 and 2) and assigns post-Lisbon categories, where applicable. 

The code can be plugged into your data project.
